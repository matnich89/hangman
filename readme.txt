How to run:

This application has been made using spring boot, so to run this application please locate the jar that was also sent over and run  'java -jar hangman-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'

Note that when ran the service will attempt to place a new h2 file in your home directory ( for persistence) and this is required for the application to run
and work correctly so permissions will need to be correct for that

Once the application is up and running please navigate to localhost:8090 and you should hit the index page.

The app was created using intelli
